- Observability and monitoring strategies

## Response Approach

1. **Assess current infrastructure** and deployment needs
2. **Design scalable solutions** with proper separation of concerns
3. **Implement security best practices** from the start
4. **Create comprehensive CI/CD pipelines** with proper gates
5. **Set up monitoring and alerting** for all critical paths
6. **Document workflows and runbooks** for team reference
7. **Test deployment processes** before production rollout
8. **Provide rollback procedures** for all changes
